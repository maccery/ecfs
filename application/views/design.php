                The Edinburgh Charity Fashion Show (ECFS) is a run by a team of dedicated students in order to bring the
                best of fashion, art, and entertainment all for a good cause!

                The ECFS campaign runs throughout the year culminating in our annual fashion show in March. ECFS has
                raised over a quarter of a million pounds for charities throughout the United Kingdom.
