                We would like to invite you to sponsor the Edinburgh Charity Fashion Show 2015 supporting Scottish Mental
                Health and Elephant Family. In exchange, we would happily advertise your business across all of our
                social media platforms including Facebook, our official website and blog. Your company logo would be
                featured on all official ECFS 2015 literature leading up to and on the night of the show. We would be
                delighted to discuss this opportunity with you further, and we would appreciate the chance to present to
                you the multitude of ways the Edinburgh charity fashion show 2015 could showcase your company to tens of
                thousands of students.
