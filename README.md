# ECFS 2015 website
I was instructed to create a website for ECFS 2015. I built a site that used Facebook's API to fetch images from their Facebook page, so that the website and Facebook albums would be completely synchronised. I also used a combination of LESS and Bootstrap for a responsive webdesign, following criteria set by the committee. I also did a bit of Wordpress integration to include a Blog on the site that would share the same design. Unfortunately I was under some time constraints and so the code wasn't as neat as I would have liked it to have been.

## Tools used
- Bootstrap
- LESS
- Codeigniter
- Facebook API
- Wordpress
